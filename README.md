1. Combined both file creations in one command
2. Enhanced `.gitignore` with:
   - Better Python-specific ignores
   - Organized sections (Python, Build, IDEs, System)
3. Compact README with:
   - Emoji visual markers
   - Minimal essential information
   - Clear separation of concerns

To verify both files:
```bash
